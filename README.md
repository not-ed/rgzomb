About
</h1>

RGzomB is a 2D retro-style arcade game that combines elements from a mixture of Pacman and Galaga in order to create a game that demands careful resource management, level navigation, color association, and a constant awareness as to the whereabouts of enemies on screen, particularly as a run goes on. <br><br>
From a programming standpoint, this game implements basic enemy behaviour states, a local high score counter which keeps track of a player's best run between gameplay sessions, and dynamically handles the scaling of pixel-perfect graphics in the Unity engine to any set resolution while the game is running in order to ensure the game takes up as much screen space as possible whilst ensuring that individual pixels remain evenly sized and crisp on-screen.
